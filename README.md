# (Python) Image to ANSI Converter

*Credit where credit is due.*

This python script is based off of original work by Micah Elliott (MicahElliott) located in Gist colortrans.py and improved on by Takumi Sueda (puhitaku). A big thanks to those foundations.

## Purpose

This script uses python libraries to provide a way to take image files and make them color compatible for use in a shell (ANSI). Which allows display of terminal art such as that contained in the demo.png file.

### Prerequisites


### To-Do List

- [] Review sizing of output. Currently images larger than 50x50 are not very practical for console use.
- [] Update script to display help information on run without variable or --help option
